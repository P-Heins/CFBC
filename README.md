Channelflow Boundary Condition Package (CFBC)

The CFBC package allows a user to implement inhomogeneous wall boundary conditions into the open-source spectral CFD code Channelflow written by J. F. Gibson. The package also includes a C++ controller class to aid in the simulation of linear time-invariant (LTI) output-feedback controllers in feedback with turbulent channelflow. All programs included in the package have been validated and used by the author for published research. For more information on Channelflow, please visit www.channelflow.org. Information on installing the CFBC package along with Channelflow can be found in UserGuide.pdf.   

CFBC was written by P. H. Heins from the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, The University of Sheffield, U.K. for work conducted as part of his PhD between 2012-2015.    

The majority of code in "dns.cpp", "dns.h", "tausolver.cpp" and "tausolver.h" was written by J. F. Gibson, and the added code written by P. H. Heins is clearly identifiable. P. H. Heins does not claim to have written any of the code in these files that is not identified as his.
